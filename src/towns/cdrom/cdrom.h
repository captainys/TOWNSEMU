      Push parameter queue -> and then send command, or
      Send command first -> and then push parameter queue.
    My guess is either:
      A the Internal CD drive starts doing something when both are given, or
      B there are some time after a command was written and before the CD controller starts reading parameter queue.

/*! 4-byte Status Code from CD-ROM Drive
My guess based on the BIOS Disassembly:
00H xx  xx xx  Probably No Error
00H 03H xx xx  CDDA is playing
00H 09H xx xx  Drive Not Ready   Towns OS V2.1 L20 CD-ROM BIOS 0421:277C
07H ??         The BIOS is checking, but the meaning is unknown.
xxH 01H xx xx  Probably Parameter Error
21H 01H xx xx  Probably Parameter Error
21H 02H        Probably Parameter Error
21H 0CH        Probably Parameter Error
21H 0FH        Probably Abnormal Termination
21H 05H        Probably Media Error (like bad sector)
21H 06H        Probably Media Error (like bad sector)
21H 07H        Probably Media Error (like bad sector)
21H 03H        Probably Hard Error
21H 04H        Probably Hard Error
21H 09H xx xx  Probably Hard Error
21H 0DH xx xx  Probably Hard Error
21H 08H        Probably Media Changed
    What about drive-not-ready?
00H 08H xx xx  Seems to be also media-changed.  Towns OS V2.1 L20 CD-ROM BIOS 0421:277C

00H 01H xx xx  Probably CDDA Paused?  Reponse to command A0H.  INT 93H AX=55C0H returns AH=22H (already paused)
               if CDC returns 00 01 xx xx on command A0H.


My guess based on the Boot-ROM Disassembly:
04H xxH xx xx   Probably Seek done (After issuing 20H Seek, it waits for 00H No Error, and then 04H)
00H 04H xx xx   CDROM BIOS re-shoots command A0H if CDROM returns this code.       (0b00000100)
00H 08H xx xx   CDROM BIOS re-shoots command A0H if CDROM returns this code.       (0b00001000)
00H 0DH xx xx   CDROM BIOS Checking (2ndByte)&0x0D and wait for it to be non zero. (0b00001101)

Interpretation in the Linux for Towns source towns_cd.c (static void process_event(u_char st))
00H 09H xx xx  Media change?                                                       (0b00001001)
00H xx  xx xx  No error
01H xx  xx xx  Command Accept Error
22H xx  xx xx  Data Ready
06H xx  xx xx  Read Done
07H xx  xx xx  CDDA Play Done
09H xx  xx xx  Door open
10H xx  xx xx  Door close Media not exists
11H xx  xx xx  Stop done
12H xx  xx xx  Pause done
13H xx  xx xx  Resume done
16H MM  xx xx  TOC Read  (MM>>4)==0 Mode 1  (MM>>4)==4 Mode 2  Else Mode 0  What's mode?
17H            TOC Read2
18H            SUBQ Read
19H            SUBQ Read2
20H            SUBQ Read3
21H 05H        Read Audio Track
21H 07H        Drive Not Ready   <- This is probably wrong.  CD-ROM BIOS returns media error for 21 07 xx xx.
21H 08H        Media Changed
21H 0FH        Retry?

		Orgel first revision plays back movie without synchronizing with CD pre-fetch.
		When the CD speed is too fast, pre-fetch function apparently overflows the buffer and crashes.
		CD reading needs to be slowed down.
		What I haven't figure is why faster CPU speed does not compensate for this problem.
		With faster CPU clock, the picture runs way much faster than the voice.
		Nonetheless, slowing down CPU to 12MHz, and using MAX_SEEK_TIME=500ms, it did run without crash.
		There might be a cap in the picture-update rate?  Or, something to do with voice?
		The program may be trying to synchronizing by looking at the PCM playback?
		It does crash if I run it on real FM TOWNS II MX.
		DATAWEST later released a revised version that can be used in faster FM TOWNS models.
		Presumably, the bug-fixed version does not require this delay.
